# Novel-Steganographic-Scheme-EC521-Leetz

TODO:

1. Function to send IP packets containing stegotext. [Crashes]

2. Function to recieve IP packets and extract the stegotext, so that we can operate on it. [Crashes]

3. write the paper to be more formal and rigorous, check grammar and coherence as well.

4. Fix client and server crashing after sending stegotext.

5. add the options to chose the key(base64), nonce(base64) and neural network model (hdf5). And the IV for the NN model.(more on the NN IV later, will be written in the paper).

6. better support for hosting on remote servers.

7. Clear and concise documentation and demos.

8. Minor error in the steganofunction where output has missing bits on specific inputs.


################long#term#############
8. after the protocol is finished, we need statistical analysis of the distinguishability between the steganotext and real human text.
